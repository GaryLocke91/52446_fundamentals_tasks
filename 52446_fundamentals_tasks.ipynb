    "Both lists and dictionaries are mutable data structures containing one or more data points, and can be nested inside a list or a dictionary. They do not have to be homogenous, so they can contain number, string and Boolean values. The primary difference between them is that lists are ordered and dictionaries are not. For example, ```list[0]``` refers to the first element in the list while ```dict[0]``` refers to the key value and returns the corresponding value. [1][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create an empty list and dictionary. To maintain consistency, a for loop is used to convert any string items to uppercase using the ```upper()``` function, which are then appended to the new list. [3][4] The dictionary is then populated by using a for loop to iterate over each item in the new list. [5] When iterating over each item, the ```isinstance()``` function is used to determine if the item is a list or a tuple. [6] If the item is a list or a tuple, a for loop is used to iterate over each item. If the item is not in the dictionary, the value is incremented. If otherwise, the value is set to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "One limitation of the ```count()``` function is in relation to counting Boolean values. ```True``` is a built-in enumeration with a value of 1. Thus, the hash function sees ```True``` as ```1``` and vice versa depending on which one appears in the list first. [7]"

    "*The numpy.random.binomial function can be used to simulate flipping a coin with a 50/50 chance of heads or tails. Interestingly, if a coin is flipped many times then the number of heads is well approximated by a bell-shaped curve. For instance, if we flip a coin 100 times in a row the chance of getting 50 heads is relatively high, the chances of getting 0 or 100 heads is relatively low, and the chances of getting any other number of heads decreases as you move away from 50 in either direction towards 0 or 100. Write some python code that simulates flipping a coin 100 times. Then run this code 1,000 times, keeping track of the number of heads in each of the 1,000 simulations. Select an appropriate plot to depict the resulting list of 1,000 numbers, showing that it roughly follows a bell-shaped curve. You should explain your work in a Markdown cell above the code.*"
